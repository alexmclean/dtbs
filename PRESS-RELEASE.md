## Databases Made Simple ##
  > Our online database design application makes it easy to draw up and save professional flowchart diagrams. From brainstorming to writing code, we support all of your database needs.

## Why ##
  > The first step to designing a well-thought out database is the layout of the schemas and their relationships. Other free tools available on the web support relational data, but dtbs is the only tool that supports both SQL and MongoDB, alongside several ORM frameworks. Now you can design databases without writing a line of code, and see the creation code output in the code editor. If you have an existing database that you would like to see visualised, simply type or paste it into the editor to see your schemas come to life in D3 and Snap SVG.

## How ##
  > Signup, login, or just get started straight away. Select a database type and choose between the forms or type straight into the expandable code editor on the right - you can even use both! Toggle between views to look at different representations of your database. Drag nodes and tables around, and collapse/anchor them as needed. When your work is done, export generated code to the correct file formats, download canvas images, or save your work in our database - if using SQL tables, your positions won't be lost.
